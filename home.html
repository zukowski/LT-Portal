            <h2>About this site</h2>
            <p>This experimental site consists purely of html and javascript. There is no database, no server-side code. Templates are all ajax loaded so there is no need for page refresh.</p>
            <p>If you click on the Projects menu item, the list of projects is pulled in by making an ajax request to the Ruby on Rails <a href="http://zuke.sandbox.zmdev.net:3000/">Project Browser</a> (also in development). This site is basically a bunch of html containers and some jQuery that triggers http REST requests to an off-site Rails project which returns data in json format.</p>
            <p>At the moment, the Project Browser cannot receive cross-domain ajax requests, so this site proxies it's requests through a simple PHP script that forwards the request and returns data to the client using file_get_contents() to send/receive data from Rails. We'll need to look into setting up jsonp support in Rails so we can make cross-domain requests straight from jQuery.</p>
